# Architecture & Decisions

Source brief: [prompts/project-setup.md](../prompts/project-setup.md). This file is the synthesized design; the executable work lives in [plans/](plans/README.md).

## 1. Verified environment (2026-09-28)

| Item | Value | How verified |
|---|---|---|
| CPU / RAM | i5-12600K (10C/16T), 31.8 GB | `Get-CimInstance` |
| GPU | RTX 5070, 12 GB VRAM | `nvidia-smi` |
| Disk | C: 722 GB free | `Get-CimInstance Win32_LogicalDisk` |
| OS | Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200 | |
| Docker | 29.6.1 (Docker Desktop, daemon was **not running**) | `docker --version`, `docker ps` failed on npipe |
| WSL default distro | `podman-machine-default` (Docker Desktop uses its own distro; not a blocker) | `wsl --status` |
| Ollama | 0.34.4, native Windows | `ollama --version` |
| LangFlow Desktop | 1.12.0 installed (not used by this project, see D2) | dist-info in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.LangflowDesktop` |
| Python / Node / uv | 3.12.10 / 24.14.1 / uv present | |
| gh CLI, psql | not installed | |
| Repo location | inside OneDrive (sync risk, see D6) | |

### Model tests (run against local Ollama)
| Model | Size in VRAM | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `hf.co/danish-foundation-models/DFM-Mimir-GGUF:Q4_K_M` | 4.2 GB, 100% GPU | Arch `hrm_text`, 1.79B params, **4096 ctx**. Danish QA correct. `format=json` extraction correct. ~118 tok/s. **Tool-call test: no tool call emitted** despite `tools` capability. |
| `qwen2.5:14b` (installed) | 9.5 GB, 100% GPU | Tool-call test: correct `find_application(company, title)` call. |

Implication: both models together (≈13.7 GB) exceed 12 GB VRAM — Ollama evicts one. Pipeline must batch work by model (see D1).

## 2. Decisions (confirmed with user)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Hybrid local LLMs.** `qwen2.5:14b` = orchestration, parsing, tool calls, extraction, rubric scoring, chat edits. **DFM-Mimir** = document writing (CV, cover letter, recruiter email) in fixed, non-agent flow steps. `bge-m3` (Ollama) = multilingual embeddings. All via Ollama; no cloud LLMs. | Mimir can't tool-call reliably and has 4k ctx; strongest DA/EN writer. |
| D2 | **LangFlow in Docker Compose**, image `langflowai/langflow` pinned to `1.12.x`. Ollama stays **native on Windows** (GPU); containers reach it at `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. | Reproducible, versioned. |
| D3 | **Email intake via IMAP polling** (app password). | Provider-agnostic. |
| D4 | **Posting text: mixed.** Use email body if it contains a full description; else fetch URL; else mark `needs_manual_text` for user paste. LinkedIn pages are not scraped. | Emails vary. |
| D5 | **Documents authored in Markdown, rendered to PDF** (WeasyPrint in backend container). | Easiest for LLM + chat editing. |
| D6 | **Data outside OneDrive.** `DATA_ROOT` (default `C:\JobSearchData`) holds blob storage, profile inputs (CV, templates), and Docker bind mounts. Repo code may stay in OneDrive. | Avoid sync locks/corruption. |
| D7 | **GitHub + GitHub Actions + release-please**, Conventional Commits, single SemVer for the whole repo. | Basic CI/CD with release versions. |
| D8 | **Hybrid match score** 0–100 = `w_e * embedding_cosine + w_r * rubric_score`, weights and threshold in config (defaults 0.4/0.6, threshold 70). | Stable + explainable. |

## 3. Assumptions (not asked; change if wrong)
- A1 Single local user; frontend/API bound to localhost; no auth beyond a shared API key between services.
- A2 Generated documents use the **posting's language** (Danish or English). Other languages → status `unsupported_language`, stop.
- A3 Frontend chat editing also uses local models (qwen2.5:14b), consistent with "LLM calls must be local".
- A4 Application submission is always manual (user opens link from the Queue tab).
- A5 Duplicate = same `source_url`/source job id, OR pg_trgm similarity ≥ 0.85 on normalized company + title within 120 days (configurable).
- A6 User inputs (CV, cover letter template, recruiter email template) are converted to Markdown and kept in `DATA_ROOT/profile/`, never committed. Repo holds only `*.example.md` stubs.

## 4. Component responsibilities

```
IMAP ─► FastAPI worker (scheduler) ──run flow──► LangFlow (agents) ──► Ollama (host GPU)
                 │  ▲                                  │
                 │  └──── tool endpoints (REST) ◄──────┘
                 ▼
          PostgreSQL (app DB + langflow DB)      Blob: DATA_ROOT/applications/<id>/
                 ▲
React UI ──► FastAPI ◄── Phoenix (traces from LangFlow + FastAPI, OTLP)
```

- **FastAPI** is the single owner of the DB schema and blob storage. LangFlow never touches Postgres/app tables directly; it calls FastAPI tool endpoints. FastAPI also schedules IMAP polling and iterates jobs (one LangFlow run per job → idempotent, retryable).
- **LangFlow** hosts the multi-agent logic as flows exported to `langflow/flows/*.json`, plus custom components in `langflow/components/`.
- **Phoenix** receives traces from LangFlow (native integration) and FastAPI (OpenTelemetry).

## 5. Workflow mapping (brief steps → implementation)

| Step | Owner | Model |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Receive email | FastAPI IMAP poller; stores `email_message` by Message-ID (idempotent) | – |
| 2 Split into jobs | LangFlow **Intake agent** → JSON list of jobs (title, company, url, snippet) | qwen |
| 3–4 Dedup, stop if exists | FastAPI `POST /tools/applications/find` (A5), called per job | – |
| 5 Insert row | `POST /tools/applications` → `fact_application` status `new` (upserts `dim_company`) | – |
| (D4) Get full text | FastAPI fetcher (httpx + trafilatura) | – |
| 6 Language | **Analyst agent** (+ cheap `lingua`/langdetect pre-check) | qwen |
| 7 Recruiter contact | Analyst agent, JSON output; regex pre-extract emails/phones | qwen |
| 8 Keywords/requirements | Analyst agent → `job_brief` JSON (≤ 600 tokens) | qwen |
| 9 Similarity score | **Matcher agent**: bge-m3 cosine (CV sections vs brief) + rubric (D8) | bge-m3, qwen |
| 10 Stop if weak | status `low_match` (terminal) | – |
| 11 Create folder | `POST /tools/applications/{id}/folder` → `DATA_ROOT/applications/<yyyy-mm>_<company>_<title>_<id>/` | – |
| 12 Tailored CV | **CV Writer**: section-by-section rewrite to fit 4k ctx | Mimir |
| 13 Cover letter | **Letter Writer**: brief + top CV evidence + template | Mimir |
| 14 Recruiter email | **Email Writer** (only if contact found, else generic) | Mimir |
| 15 Save artifacts | `POST /tools/applications/{id}/artifacts` → `.md` + rendered `.pdf`; status `generated` | – |

VRAM batching: the worker runs steps 2–10 for all new jobs (qwen phase), then 12–14 for all matches (Mimir phase), using Ollama `keep_alive` to avoid swapping per job.

Mimir 4k context budget per call: system+instructions ≤ 600, job brief ≤ 600, CV evidence ≤ 1200, template/section ≤ 600, output ≤ 1000 tokens.

## 6. Application status lifecycle
`new → analyzed → low_match` (terminal) | `→ matched → generating → generated → approved (queued) → submitted | declined`; `skip` only reorders the queue. Side statuses: `duplicate`, `needs_manual_text`, `unsupported_language`, `error`. Every change is written to `application_event`.
