# 04 — Local models setup & evaluation

**Depends on:** 03 · **Branch:** `feat/04-models`

## Goal
Pin the local models, confirm with a small repeatable benchmark that `gemma4:12b` covers every LLM role (D1, revised 2026-09-28), and fix `num_ctx` and the VRAM strategy.

## Known facts (from architecture §1; don't re-test unless versions change)
- Usable VRAM is about 10.7 GB, because Windows holds about 1.5 GB of the 12 GB.
- `gemma4:12b`: 7.6 GB file, 256K max context, tools + thinking per the Ollama library. **Not yet tested on this machine.**
- Baselines already measured: Mimir Q4_K_M has 4096 ctx, 4.2 GB VRAM, good Danish, **no tool calls**. qwen2.5:14b has 9.5 GB VRAM and correct tool calls.

## Steps
1. **`scripts/pull-models.ps1`**: pulls `gemma4:12b` and `bge-m3`. A `-Baselines` switch also pulls `hf.co/danish-foundation-models/DFM-Mimir-GGUF:Q4_K_M` and `qwen2.5:14b` for the benchmark comparison. Idempotent; prints `ollama list`.
2. **Ollama server settings**: test `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1` and `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0` (user-level env vars, Ollama restart needed). Keep them only if Gemma 4 output quality holds and VRAM use drops (`ollama ps`). Document the result and the setup command in `docs/model-evaluation.md`.
3. **Gemma Modelfile** `infra/ollama/Gemma.Modelfile` → `ollama create ajs-gemma`: `FROM gemma4:12b`, keep the embedded chat template and stop tokens (see `ollama show --modelfile`), set `num_ctx`. Start at 16384 and pick the largest value that stays 100% GPU with `bge-m3` loaded at the same time (`ollama ps`). Temperature is set per request, not in the Modelfile, so agent and writer calls share one loaded model. App config values, not hard-coded: `LLM_AGENT_MODEL=ajs-gemma`, `LLM_WRITER_MODEL=ajs-gemma`, `EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3`.
4. **Benchmark harness** `backend/evals/model_bench.py` (run with `uv run`): calls the Ollama HTTP API directly. Inputs: 5–10 real postings (DA + EN) the user provides in `DATA_ROOT/profile/eval_postings/` (ask user). Tasks, run on `ajs-gemma` and on the baselines:
   - tool call: the `find_application(company, title)` test from architecture §1; measure correct-call %.
   - extraction → `job_brief` JSON schema (title, company, language, contact, must_have[], nice_to_have[], keywords[]); measure schema validity %.
   - rubric scoring with Gemma thinking **off** vs **on** (`think` request option); record agreement and wall time.
   - cover-letter paragraph in the posting language, Gemma vs Mimir. Shuffle and hide the model names; the user rates 1–5 in a CSV.
   - tokens/s and wall time per model.
   Output `DATA_ROOT/evals/<date>.md` (not committed); commit only the harness and a summary table in `docs/model-evaluation.md` (no personal content).
5. **VRAM strategy**: document in `docs/model-evaluation.md` the chosen `keep_alive` values and confirm `ajs-gemma` + `bge-m3` stay co-resident at 100% GPU through a full analysis + generation run. If they don't, first lower `num_ctx`; if that fails, record `qwen3.5:9b` (6.6 GB) as the tested fallback.
6. **Token budgeting helper** spec (implemented in plan 09): count tokens with the Gemma 4 tokenizer (`tokenizer.json` via the `tokenizers` lib). If the Hugging Face repo is gated, fall back to a conservative characters-per-token estimate. Check either method against Ollama's `prompt_eval_count`. It enforces the writer budgets in architecture §5, scaled to the chosen `num_ctx`.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `ollama list` shows `ajs-gemma` and `bge-m3`.
- [ ] Benchmark runs end-to-end; summary committed in `docs/model-evaluation.md`.
- [ ] Decision recorded: `num_ctx`, `keep_alive`, thinking on/off per task, flash attention/KV cache settings.
- [ ] If Gemma fails the tool-call test, or Mimir clearly wins the blind Danish writing rating, **stop and ask the user** before changing D1.
