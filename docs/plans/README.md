# Implementation Plans

Each plan is sized for **one agent session**. Read [../architecture.md](../architecture.md) first; it holds verified facts, decisions (D1–D8) and assumptions (A1–A6) that every plan relies on. Do not re-decide them; if one proves wrong, stop and ask the user, then update architecture.md.

## Order & status

| 05 | [Database schema & migrations](05-database-schema.md) | 03 | todo |
| 06 | [FastAPI core & tool endpoints](06-fastapi-core.md) | 05 | todo |
| 07 | [Email intake & posting fetcher](07-email-intake.md) | 06 | todo |

| 09 | [LangFlow flows: document generation](09-langflow-generation-flows.md) | 08 | todo |
| 10 | [Observability & governance](10-observability-governance.md) | 08 | todo |

| 14 | [End-to-end test & v0.1.0 release](14-e2e-and-first-release.md) | all | todo |

Parallelizable after 06: {07, 08, 11}; after 11: {12 (needs 09), 13}.

## Rules for executing agents
1. Set this plan's status to `in progress` at start and `done` at end (in this table).
2. Stay in scope. Out-of-scope discoveries go under **Follow-ups** at the bottom of this file.
3. Work on a branch `feat/NN-short-name`; Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`); open a PR once plan 02 is done.
4. Every plan ends with its **Acceptance criteria** checked and verified by running the listed commands; report failures honestly.
5. No cloud LLM SDKs or API keys anywhere in the app (governance rule; enforced by plan 10).
6. Never commit personal data (CV, templates, emails, `.env`).

## Follow-ups
_(append here)_
- (02) Plans 05 and 11 mention an `x-release-please-version` marker. It is not needed: `release-please-config.json` updates `project.version` in `backend/pyproject.toml` and `version` in `frontend/package.json` through toml/json `extra-files`.
- (02 → 05) CI runs `uv run mypy` with no arguments, so `backend/pyproject.toml` needs `[tool.mypy] files = [...]`. CI provides `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://jobsearch:jobsearch@localhost:5432/jobsearch_test` (Postgres 17 service).
- (02 → 06, 11) The release workflow builds images with the package directory (`backend/`, `frontend/`) as the Docker build context, so Dockerfiles must not reference files outside it.
- (02 → 14) The release PR is opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so no checks run on it. Either merge it as admin (the ruleset allows admin bypass on PRs only) or add a fine-grained PAT secret `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`. See `docs/releasing.md`.
- (02 → 14) With no `v0.0.0` tag, release-please ignores the `0.0.0` manifest entry, so `release-please-config.json` sets `initial-version: 0.1.0`. A release PR titled `chore(main): release 0.1.0` stays open until plan 14; do not merge it earlier.
- (03 → 07) The backend service mounts only `DATA_ROOT/applications` and `DATA_ROOT/profile` (read-only). Plan 07 writes `DATA_ROOT/inbox/`: add that folder to `scripts/init-data-root.ps1` and a mount to `backend`/`worker`. Also add the `worker` service to the stop list in `dev.ps1 reset-db`.
- (03 → 06, 14) `dev.ps1 reset-db` drops the LangFlow DB too, so `LANGFLOW_API_KEY` and imported flows are gone afterwards. Recreate the key in the LangFlow UI and re-import flows (plan 14's e2e script must do this).
- (03 → 08) The LangFlow 1.12.3 image runs Python 3.14; custom components must work on it. Components are mounted read-only and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` keeps `.pyc` out of the OneDrive repo.
- (03 → 10) Phoenix stores SQLite data in `DATA_ROOT/phoenix` (`PHOENIX_WORKING_DIR`); telemetry is off in Phoenix and LangFlow. LangFlow has `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://phoenix:6006`, but trace delivery has not been verified.
- (03) This machine had an unrelated `langflow` container (`langflowai/langflow:latest`) publishing port 7860. The user agreed to stop it and set its restart policy to `no`. If `dev.ps1 up` fails with "port is already allocated", check `docker ps` for other stacks.
- (02) On this machine git's OpenSSL backend fails TLS to github.com (likely HTTPS interception by antivirus or a proxy). The repo-local git config sets `http.sslBackend=schannel`, and `uvx` needs `--system-certs`.
